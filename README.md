# Aroma Agents: Multi-Stage Emotional Support System

**Aroma Agents** is a multi-agent emotional wellness pipeline powered by large language models and the [Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://github.com/google/adk-python). The system interprets user input to detect emotional context and delivers personalized aroma suggestions, herbal mappings, music generation, and gentle voice-based support.

This project demonstrates how to build an **LLM-powered agent chain** for enhancing emotional well-being using structured ADK pipelines and real-world generative APIs.

## üß† Key Use Case

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been feeling anxious lately due to exams and want something to help me relax.‚Äù

The Aroma Agent processes this request to:

1. Understand the user‚Äôs emotional context.
2. Recommend aroma compounds that are known to help.
3. Map them to real herbs or plant products.
4. Suggest how to use them (e.g., tea, diffuser).
5. Compose a short encouraging message with synthesized voice output.
6. Generate a soft musical track with healing vibes.

    D --> E[Recommender Agent]
    E --> F[Mental Support Agent + TTS]
    E --> G[Music Agent + Lyrics + MP3]
```

Each agent is modular and communicates via structured inputs and outputs defined with Pydantic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
poetry install
```

### 2. Set up `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXX
SUNO_API_KEY=YYYYYYYY
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
```

These keys allow access to:

* [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)
* [Suno API](https://sunoapi.org/) for music generation

### 3. Run the Agent

```bash
adk run Aroma_Agents
```

This will launch the `SequentialAgent` defined in `agent.py`.

---

## üß© Agent Details

### Intent Parser Agent

Extracts:

* `mood` (e.g., anxious, tired)
* `context` (e.g., work, study, social)
* `preferences` (e.g., tea, diffuser, music)

> Powered by: `gemini-2.0-flash`

---

### Compound Searcher Agent

Recommends aroma compounds such as `linalool`, `citronellal`, `menthol`.

> Prompt and reasoning are model-driven based on emotional context.

---

### Plant Mapper Agent

Maps compounds to real plants and parts used (e.g., lavender flower, peppermint leaf).

---

### Recommender Agent

Outputs:

* Suggested use: tea, inhaler, diffuser, massage
* Explanation: therapeutic context and scent profile

---

### Mental Support Agent + TTS

Generates a brief kind message like:

> "You‚Äôre doing your best. Remember to breathe and be gentle with yourself."

Then converts this to audio using Gemini TTS (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts`) via:

```python
GeminiTTSGenerator.generate_audio()
```

---

### Music Agent + MP3

* Generates lyrics using Gemini
* Submits request to Suno API
* Polls status
* Downloads and saves `.mp3` file locally

Output file is saved to `/music_outputs/`.

[mental_support_agent]: Oh, sweetheart, I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. Failing a final exam is incredibly tough, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, with that tightness in your chest and the tears. Please know that you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to cry and let those emotions out.

Take a deep breath, if you can. It's just one exam, and it doesn't define your worth or your future. It's a setback, yes, but setbacks are a part of life's journey. Think about Lavender, Bergamot, or Lemon; maybe imagining their scents could offer a tiny bit of comfort right now.  

For this moment, give yourself permission to just be. Be sad, be upset, but also be kind to yourself. You deserve kindness and compassion, especially now. We will figure things out.

[mental_support_agent]: I've created an audio file with that comforting message for you. I hope it helps, even just a little. Remember, I'm here to listen whenever you need.

[music_agent]: Okay, I will write a song for you. Here are the lyrics:

(Verse 1)
The weight of the world, it crashed on down,
A wave of despair in this lonely town.
The test is done, the results are in,
And a storm of emotions begins.

(Chorus)
But hold on, darling, don't lose your light,
There's still a star in the darkest night.
This moment's a whisper, it won't define,
The strength that's within, the future that's thine.

(Verse 2)
Feel the tightness, the tears that fall,
It's okay to stumble, it's part of it all.
Like lavender fields, breathe in so deep,
Let calmness surround you, secrets to keep.

(Chorus)
But hold on, darling, don't lose your light,
There's still a star in the darkest night.
This moment's a whisper, it won't define,
The strength that's within, the future that's thine.

(Bridge)
Like bergamot's scent, let worries fade,
A citrusy promise, a new serenade.
You're more than a grade, more than a test,
A spirit so bright, divinely blessed.

(Chorus)
But hold on, darling, don't lose your light,
There's still a star in the darkest night.
This moment's a whisper, it won't define,
The strength that's within, the future that's thine.

(Outro)
So breathe in the lemon, its zest so alive,
You're resilient, darling, you will survive.
The sun will rise, and you'll find your way,
Brighter and stronger, each and every day.
